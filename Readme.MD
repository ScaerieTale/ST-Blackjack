# Place your bets!
... Okay not really.  It's Blackjack, in CLI form!  Thankfully this is the first capstone projefct so hopefully we'll be moving on to something more useful than a tip calculator soon .

# Update 2
Well, I'm finished for now.  The Dealer doesn't really have a chance to win unless they get 21, an I do intend to come back and implement that later, but I've been working on this for like 3 days now.  I'm ready to move on to the next project since the spirit of the project was to learn about implementing functions and nesting functions, etc. which I think I did a pretty good job with.
## TO DO:
Besides a graphical interface? :P  I want to reassign 10, 10 and 10 to Jack, Queen and King using nested Definitions (where the title is the Key, and the value is 10) or something like that..  For flavor I'd like to add four suits as well.  You know, ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠.  But for now, I'm going to take a break, get some water, and then hit the books!

## Update 1:
Screenshot I just added to the git is because nobody would believe me without photographic evidence of what just happened!  I had just finished coding the player/dealer hand after having to tear apart a function that I realized I would only ever need once (whoops!)

I ran the code, and...
Dealer: 2
Your hand: 10, 11!

What?  I got a blackjack on my very first successful run of this code.  Y'all that just made my whole night! :-)
