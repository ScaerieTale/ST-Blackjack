# Place your bets!
... Okay not really.  It's Blackjack, in CLI form!  Thankfully this is the first capstone projefct so hopefully we'll be moving on to something more useful than a tip calculator soon lol

Screenshot I just added to the git is because nobody would believe me without photographic evidence of what just happened!  I had just finished coding the player/dealer hand after having to tear apart a function that I realized I would only ever need once (whoops!)

I ran the code, and...
Dealer: 2
Your hand: 10, 11!

What?  I got a blackjack on my very first successful run of this code.  Y'all that just made my whole night! :-)
